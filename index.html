    <h1>Why I Love D&D</h1>

    <p>I'm pretty sure most of us know what D&D is, but for those who don't, I will give a brief explanation of what and who invented it.</p>
    <div id="intro">
     <h2>Introduction</h2>
     <p>Dungeons and Dragons was invented in 1974 by Gary Gygax and Dave Arneson, originally called Chainmail this would go to become <span class="bold">Dungeons and Dragons 1st Edition</span>. Despite 
     both Gary Gygax and Dave Arneson created D&D, Gary Gygax is called the father of D&D. Thats the history, lets talk about what D&D is before we continue. D&D is considered a 
     "<span class="bold">TTRPG</span>" which stands for "Table Top Role Playing Game", what does that mean? It boils down to creating a fictional character and embody the character during decisions
     and interactions.</p>

    <div id="meat">
     <h2>The Meat</h2>
     <p>With all that said, why do I enjoy D&D? The reasons I enjoy D&D is for a few reasons, the Mechanics, the Role-play, and Friends. Let's start with the Mechanics, for me the Mechanics
     are complex yet simple enough that it allows for fun rule combinations and yet are easy enough to comprehend. For an example D&D is a number game, where you usually have a <span class="bold">+1</span>,
     or something like that, due to this people try and get the hights plus's possible. However the creators have made it to where similar plus's don't stack. I won't go into to much detail, 
     less I bore you. Why did I put Role-playing on my list. Simple <span class="bold">Its Fun!</span> Let me clear something up real quick, when I say "Role-play" I don't mean something you
     do in the bedroom, I'm referring to embodying/Acting as someone else, making decisions they would make. To me it's therapeutic to act like someone else with my close friends, which leads me
     to my final point. Friends, everything is better with them</p>
